# Empowering the Nation
This is Empowering the Nation, a ficticious app providing courses for individuals looking to improve themselves.

## Team Behind App
This app was created by the following:
- Erika - ST10341302
- Jamie - ST10248714
- Matthew - ST10297294
- Quewin - ST10056112
- Zaid - ST10349417

# Milestone 1

## Requirements

Empowering the Nation’s goal is to provide skill development opportunities for domestic workers and gardeners who may never have had the chance to complete a formal educational qualification

To achieve this, the specifications requested was the creation of a mobile app and website that shared functionality and design. Users needed freedom to use either platform and have a positive UI/UX experience when navigating

The following screens were required:

- Home (With Logo and About Us Text)
- Summary of six-month Courses
- Summary of six-week Courses
- Details of each six-month course (separate page/screen for each course)
- Details of each six-month course (separate page/screen for each course)
- Calculate Total Fees
- Contact Details

These screens were required on both app and website. Navigation required each screen return to their previous page 

# Milestone 2
## Submission
Team reviewed each proposed wireframe and logo, deciding on a single wireframe and logo to base design. 
Matthew's wireframe and Quewin's logo was selected with colour corrections to design

# Milestone 3 
## Design Changes
The following screens were changed to better match the colorscheme and eliminate some white space

## How To Use App

## Youtube Link

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lza6E4e7nNQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lza6E4e7nNQ)

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
