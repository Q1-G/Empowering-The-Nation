# Milestone 1

## Requirements

Empowering the Nationâ€™s goal is to provide skill development opportunities for domestic workers and gardeners who may never have had the chance to complete a formal educational qualification

To achieve this, the specifications requested was the creation of a mobile app and website that shared functionality and design. Users needed freedom to use either platform and have a positive UI/UX experience when navigating

The following screens were required:

- Home (With Logo and About Us Text)
- Summary of six-month Courses
- Summary of six-week Courses
- Details of each six-month course (separate page/screen for each course)
- Details of each six-month course (separate page/screen for each course)
- Calculate Total Fees
- Contact Details

These screens were required on both app and website. Navigation required each screen return to their previous page 

# Milestone 2
## Submission
Team reviewed each proposed wireframe and logo, deciding on a single wireframe and logo to base design. 
Matthew's wireframe and Quewin's logo was selected with colour corrections to design

# Milestone 3 
## Design Changes
The following screens were changed to better match the colorscheme and eliminate some white space
